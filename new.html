      <h1>Donâ€™t touch your face!</h1>
      <p>Medical experts have advised against touching our face to avoid
        the spread of COVID-19. This tool reminds you when you are touching your
        face with audio feedback, helping you modify your behavior. </p>

      <h4>How this works?</h4>
      <p>A machine-learning algorithm was taught what people
        touching their faces & not touching their faces looks like.</p>
      <p>Using your webcam algorithm monitors you &
        alerts you when you touch your face with audio feedback.</p>
      <p>The machine is taught to recognize people who are sitting down at their desks.
        Which is it's intended context of use. If you plan to stand up or lie down on your
        bed it won't work as well. Read more about the design process.</p>

      <p>The algorithm runs locally on the browser.
        Everything runs locally & none of your data ever.</p>
      <p>Video feedback has been turned off as the application is intended to
        run passively like a browser extension to save computational load.
        To have a peek behind the curtain try out a version with video feedback.</p>
